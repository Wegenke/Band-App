# BandApp


For the group project we are going to create a web app that allows you to see what bands are coming to local venues. We can track that and set up links to purchase tickets from which ever site we decide to connect to. Also have a button to connect your facebook account and post if you are interested in any upcoming events, invite friends to join you or just put the news out there that your favorite band is coming town. Set up accounts to allow you track your band more easily. And possibly add links to youtube or spotify to preview a band that you may not be familiar with.
